                        My name is Etanami Olatunji. I am currrently an udergraduate student at Babcock University, studying computer science. I was 
                        inspired to write about forex because i see it as the next big thing for gaining financial freedom. So, it would only 
                        be fair to make that public knowledge. Do enjoy your time here.

                            The world keeps evolving day by day, and we can't afford to be left behind. Recently, the world was stunned with a global 
                            pandemic which affected everyone one way or the other, either positively or negatively. As for those that lost one person or 
                            the other, my condolensces goes out to them and may the lost souls rest in perfect peace.The pandemic made us realize we 
                            needed to have more work-from-home jobs than the usual workspace type of jobs.

                            Although i'm currently an undergraduate 
                            student, but we can all agree everyone seeks financial freedom. I had been intoduced into 
                            <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market/ " target= "_blank">forex</a> mid last year and gradually i 
                            started to learn the skill so that i could eventually set myself into financial freedom in the coming months. It was not to be,
                            because i frequently saw myself always withdrawing most of, if not all of my profits & initial capital. I was never able to 
                            build momentum as schoolwork always got me spending out of the blue week by week. Fortunaletly, i got to know and learn about 
                            multi-level marketing in forex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Multi-level marketing in forex helps you to both earn money from companies by getting 
                            new customers to sign up thereby building your downline and also giving you 24/7 mentorship, trading signals & so much 
                            more. I took my time through out the quarantine-phase to study which company offers the best in terms of positive financial 
                            impact and reviews.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of my friends have now become forex traders working & learning everyday from this beautiful opportunity. The only requirements
                            needed is your phone, accessible internet & initial sign up fee of $235 for access into their products. Lives have been changed 
                            immensely and i can only remain patient for the future that lies ahead.
